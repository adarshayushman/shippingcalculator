Bienvenue! This program will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package.

There are several different options for a customer to ship their package:

Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you are not charged for weight.
Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.

Here are the prices:

Ground Shipping:
- For packages 2 lb or less: $1.50 per pound plus a $20.00 flat charge.
- For packages over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb: $3.00 per pound plus a $20.00 flat charge.
- For packages over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb: $4.00 per pound plus a $20.00 flat charge.
